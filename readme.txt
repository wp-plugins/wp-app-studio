= Get involved =
We are in the business of making your life easier as a developer, designer or power user. Let us know how we can do our job better by suggesting new features, reporting bugs, or telling us simply something we developed worked for you. We tweet about our development, new releases, tips and tricks @eMarket_Design. We have a contact form in our site and free support ticket system in the emd playground. Thanks in advance.

= Tranlations =
We have machine-translated Wp App Studio in the following languages. We need lead translators to help finish the translations.

* Spanish
* Arabic
* Turkish
* Russian
* Portuguese

* German
* French

Please [contact us](http://emarketdesign.com/contact-us/ "Contact eMarket Design") with your gmail account (required for file sharing) if you would like to help in translating WPAS to your own language.

= Upgrading from the previous versions =
Each WPAS version adds to the functionality of our platform. Although the plugin automatically upgrades your apps to the new version. It is *strongly recommended* to go through your app's screens and validate/edit/save your data to avoid data related issues in the plugin generation time. Test your app in the playground, take advantage of the free support.

= What's new in 2.9.8? =
WPAS 2.9.8 release builds on the views module with the introduction of taxonomy views at the term level. With this release, you can create separate views for each custom taxonomy term. For example; you can create priority - high or priority - low taxonomy term views in an issue tracking app.

In addition, a list of predefined taxonomy terms can be entered in the taxonomy values field of any taxonomy, including their definitions. You can also set the default value(s) for your taxonomies. The taxonomy values entered in the WPAS are automatically created (if they don't already exist) for the corresponding taxonomy when the generated plugin is activated. This new feature also allows setting different views for taxonomies shared by different entities. For example; The Office(Entity) - Cities(Taxonomy) view can be different than the Customer(Entity) - Cities(Taxonomy) view.

WordPress currently lacks single-value taxonomy metaboxes. To ensure only one term can be selected for each entity, we implemented radio button based taxonomy metaboxes in the admin backend in the release as well. This feature was already implemented in the WPAS forms.
A summary of all new features are below;

* Updated font awesome css version in the plugin to 3.2.1
* Ability set default value(s) for taxonomies
* Miscellaneous bug fixes, look and feel improvements.
* Addition of CC and BCC in the form user and admin notifications
* Ability to customize the labels of builtin fields such as content, excerpt, title when used in the forms.
* Ability to create Taxonomy term views.
* Ability to create Entity Taxonomy views.
* Enabled Font Awesome usage in the views module.
* Ability to predefine taxonomy terms and their descriptions.
