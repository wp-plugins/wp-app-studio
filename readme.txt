= What's new in 2.8? =
WPAS 2.8 release offers better support for mobile-first apps as well as new features for precision content retrieval and display through the views module. Some of the changes are below;

* Introduced a search view type to support customization of  the layout of search form results. Now, you can create a search view and attach it to a search form. One view can be attached to multiple search forms; a handy feature if you want to use the same layout with multiple forms.
* Introduced a standard view with paged navigation for displaying any entity content.
* Added Advanced Shortcode Generator(ASG) feature which supports filtering entity content by its attributes and taxonomies. You can use operators to better filter your content and display on a page or post. The ASG can be accessed on a page or post toolbar by clicking on the WPAS button.
* Added to permission module support for views. You will be able to assign access privileges to views' content based on a user's role in your app; great for role specific reports.
* Added "No Access Message" feature to views module to alert users who lack appropriate access permissions.
* Added View header and footer to support custom reporting requirements. The view headers and footers could be used for any static text such as titles, introductions or any text related to the content.
* Added page navigation component which could be themed as jQuery UI or Bootstrap following our commitment to support both frameworks.
* Upgraded our WPAS app framework to Bootstrap 3 and Font Awesome 4.
* Upgraded the form layout editor module to support size(width) for input elements. The form layout editor now supports 12 point grid system for better precision in terms of multi-column form layouts.
* Removed Pointers module. This module will be developed sometime next year as we continue to develop higher impact modules.
* Added Targeted Device feature to support mobile-first forms.
* Added support for inline radio and checkboxes in forms.
* Added element size(height) support in forms to better match size of the buttons.
* Added multi-language support to Wp App Studio.
* Fixed various bugs reported by our customers in our backend servers.
* Cleaned up some code in the plugin side and reorganized some forms to improve readability.
* Fixed some tinymce bugs, upgraded to the latest version.
* Added a new color picker attribute type.

= What's in store for the next release? =

Here is our plan for the next release.
