WP App Studio is the World's #1 Visual WordPress Design and Development Platform for building commercial grade apps in the form of plugins. 

==  Description  == 

WP App Studio(WPAS) is a cost-effective REST API based Visual WordPress Design Development Platform offered as a service(PaaS). Use WP App Studio plugin to interact with the platform; all interactions are done through HTTPS using XML text. No coding required.

WP App Studio AUTOBAHN aims to make WordPress Plugin Development as easy as filling out a couple of forms.

= What can you do with WPAS 4 AUTOBAHN? =

* Manage your website(s) with WPAS; adding submit forms, search forms, pick from different types of views to display content, create role based content, notifications etc.
* Install and activate only one plugin in your site; your own. Supplement it with other WP plugins if needed.
* Bring your own theme. All app displayed content is responsive.
* Auto Internationalization(I18n) for all apps. Just translate two pot files.

* Finish up projects taking months or weeks to complete in matter of hours in some cases in minutes.
* Save yourself from tons of headaches and countless hours of trying to find the right answer to get something done.
* Become an independent producer. If you have an idea, you can go ahead and implement it instead of checking availability of some other resource.
* Create very advanced plugins like Software Issue Manager ENT without writing a single line of PHP code.
* Move yourself or your organization to 100% model-based, top-down development eliminating transition costs
* Save a lot of money in terms of project development costs, time to market costs, resource availability costs etc.
* Become technology or trends independent. Your apps never become obsolete if that new thing comes up. Just click the Generate button and get your app refreshed.
* Work on multiple projects at the same time spending more time on your requirements or something unique.
* Respond to requirement changes like a ninja. Click, click you're done!
