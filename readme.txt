Wp App Studio is easy to learn and use design and development tool for creating fully featured custom plugins. No coding required.

 ==  Description  == 
= Are you a WPAS user? =
* Serious about WordPress.
* No coding experience.
* Tired of writing code.
* Tired of people not updating and supporting code.
* Tired of finding, testing, retesting plugins, and still dealing with conflicts.
* Thinking life is short.
* Want to focus on something unique than reinventing the wheel.
* Don't want to deal with technology/trends changes 
* Don't want to wait weeks to get something done.
* Don't want to spend thousands to get something done.

No problem. This is it. Create your own custom plugin. Let us support it for 30 days for Free.

Wp App Studio(WPAS) is a cost-effective REST API based software as a service (SaaS) platform that creates fully featured Wordpress plugins. Saas is a software delivery model commonly used by companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon etc. In SaaS delivery model all processing takes place outside of your computer. To be able to use this platform, you must purchase API credits.

[How does WPAS work? SaaS Whaat? and others](http://emarketdesign.com/documentation/wp-app-studio-documentation/wp-app-studio-platform/)

= Two ways to use this platform =
1. Download and install this plugin, purchase API credits, design/generate plugins at your computer.(Pros)
2. Register/login to eMD Playground, get free API credits, design/generate plugins, and purchase when you are ready.(Beginners)

= What's new in 2.2? =
In this release, we added Search Forms, building more on the interface. Using search forms, you can drill down and filter your content by attributes, taxonomies, and relationships. Each seach form optionally can have operators such as equal to, less than, greater than etc. Operators change based on the attribute searched.

By making search operators optional, we wanted to give plugin owners ability to limit content access. Search forms, as well as submit forms, can be displayed to eligible users by using permissions module.  In addition, we split "required" option in attribute screen in to "Required for Submit" and "Required for Search". This option becomes very handy in a search support ticket usecase where you ask users search using email or ticket id. Even if email is required in ticket submission, it is not required for searching tickets. If a user does not want to see her other tickets associated with her email, she will be able to search using her ticket id and return specific ticket status. Search forms are fully validated on the client and server side. In other words, users will not be able to enter digits into email field and submit a search request. 

As in the submit forms, search form layouts can be designed using form layout editor. All other submit form functionality such as theming options, scheduling, ajax submissions etc. is also applicable to search forms.

As an enhancement to overall forms module, we added attributes, taxonomies, and relationship unique identifier tags to admin/user email notifications. This will open the door for more customizable offers in many business cases such as realtime offer submission based on user profile.

Another exciting feature is the inclusion of Views module. Views module will replace Shortcodes module which is deprecated as of WPAS v2.2. Using views module, you will be able to design how you want to display content. Views can be attached to search forms. For example, you can design a view for the results of a search form by adding attributes you would like to return. You can fine the results using HTML or visual layout editor. Views can also be used as stand-alone using shortcodes, perfect for content reports and analysis. We will be building more on the views module in upcoming releases.

There are also some minor changes such as the addition of relationship name in the relationship editor. Relationship name will uniquely identify a particular instance. We also added some additional API rules to minimize error occurrence probability in the code generation process.

As in the previous releases, we fixed some bugs and improved overall stability of the WPAS generated plugins.


= What's in store for the next release? =

Adding advanced filters to views and widgets modules to improve report generation. Creating custom plugin setting pages.

= Create your own plugin using Wp App Studio =
An intro to WPAS system, not updated for 2.0 but still relevant. More video tutorials in the website.

*What comes out*

* API Keys (WPAS userid and password)
* App (plugin) metadata

*What comes in*

* WPAS account balance and available\used credits info

[See Wp App Studio Platform documentation](http://emarketdesign.com/documentation/wp-app-studio-documentation/wp-app-studio-platform/ "WPAS Delivery Diagram")

= Should I install Wp App Studio plugin to my production server? =

You can install it anywhere you like. However, Wp App Studio is a development tool and we recommend you to install it to your laptop or development computer.

= Who should use this service? =
